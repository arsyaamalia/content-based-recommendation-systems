# **1. INTRODUCTION**
*   ## **What is a Content-Based Recommendation System?**
A content-based recommendation system recommends items to users based on the content or characteristics of the items. This type of recommendation system focuses on understanding the properties of items and learning user preferences from the items they have interacted with in the past.
*   ## **How Does it Work?**
The working principle of a content-based recommendation system can be summarized in a few steps:
1.   Feature Extraction: Extract relevant features from the items. For example, in a movie recommendation system, features could include genre, director, actors, and plot keywords.
2.   User Profile: Create a user profile based on their interactions with items. This profile is essentially a summary of the features of items the user has liked or interacted with in the past.
3.   Recommendation: Calculate the similarity between the user profile and each item's features. Items that are most similar to the user profile are recommended.
